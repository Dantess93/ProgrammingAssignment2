# The first function, `makeCacheMatrix` creates a special "matrix", which is
## really a list containing a function to

## 1.  set the value of the matrix
## 2.  get the value of the matrix
## 3.  set the value of the inverse of the matrix
## 4.  get the value of the inverse of the matrix

## The following function calculates the inverse of the special "matrix"
## created with the first function. It first checks to see if the
## inverse has already been calculated. If so, it `get`s the inverse from the
## cache and skips the computation. Otherwise, it calculates the inverse of
## the data and sets the value of the inverse in the cache via the `setSolve`function
------------------------------------------
  
## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
  s <- NULL
  set <- function(y) {
    x <<- y
    s <<- NULL
  }
  get <- function() x
  setSolve <- function(solve) s <<- solve
  getSolve <- function() s
  list(set = set, get = get,
       setSolve = setSolve,
       getSolve = getSolve)
}


## This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above.
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
## then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  s <- x$getSolve()
  if(!is.null(s)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(s)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  s <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setSolve(s)
  s   ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
